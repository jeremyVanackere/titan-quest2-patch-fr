00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,000
NEMESIS: Do you see the truth now?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,100
The gods, like Glaukos, are selfish children, ruining this world with power they lack the wisdom to wield.

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:17,300
Only raising Kronos can wipe away these last cursed millennia of tyranny.

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:24,000
The Moirai are cruel, sending someone so weak to challenge me.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,500
At least you won't suffer in Hades for long--when I'm done, you'll have never even been born.

6
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:43,500
What!? No! The Dye Phial should serve me!
