00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,200
NEMESIS: At last.

2
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,800
Do you know who I am?

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:31,000
No, I didn’t think so. You’re oblivious to your Fate.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,400
She did a good job hiding you from me. Aristonoe, my priestess.

5
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,000
But she couldn't hide you forever.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,400
I am Retribution herself, and you were marked for punishment long ago.

7
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:54,100
ARISTONOE: Goddess! Stop, I beg you! There's no justice in this punishment.

8
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:02,600
NEMESIS: Justice! Ha! We're all just flies in the spiderweb of the Fates! Blame them, not me!

9
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,000
ARISTONOE: Areion, now!

10
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,000
Go, run! I'll distract her. Get to the caves!
