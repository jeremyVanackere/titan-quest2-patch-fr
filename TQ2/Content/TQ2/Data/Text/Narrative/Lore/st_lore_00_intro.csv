The truth is, there\'s very little more I can teach you. \r\n\r\nForgive me if it sounds sentimental. I never expected to raise a child, and I didn\'t know how. So I trained you instead. I taught you what I hoped would help you survive.\r\n\r\nI know you have questions. About where you come from. About what all that training has been for. \r\n\r\nMeet me at the usual spot this afternoon, across the bridge. There is something I must show you.\""",""
