"WindowMode_Description","In Windowed mode you can interact with other windows more easily, and drag the edges of the window to set the size. In Windowed Fullscreen mode you can easily switch between applications. In Fullscreen mode you cannot interact with other windows as easily, but the game will run slightly faster.",""

"Resolution_Description","Display Resolution determines the size of the window in Windowed mode. In Fullscreen mode, Display Resolution determines the graphics card output resolution, which can result in black bars depending on monitor and graphics card. Display Resolution is inactive in Windowed Fullscreen mode.",""
"ResolutionWindowedFullscreen_Disabled","When the Window Mode is set to <strong>Windowed Fullscreen</>, the resolution must match the native desktop resolution.",""
